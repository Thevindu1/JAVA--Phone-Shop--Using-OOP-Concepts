Getting Started

### Opening the Project in NetBeans

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. **Open NetBeans**: Launch NetBeans IDE on your computer.

3. **Open the Project**: In NetBeans, go to `File` > `Open Project...` and select the project directory you just cloned.

### Establishing a Database Connection

To make sure the project can interact with your MySQL database, follow these steps:

1. **Download MySQL Connector/J**:

   You can download MySQL Connector/J from the following links based on your preferences Or use the given connectors in the repository:

   - [Download MySQL Connector/J 8.0.17](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/8.0.html)
   - [Download MySQL Connector/J 5.0.7](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html)

   Choose one of these drivers that suits your system.

2. **Add MySQL Connector to Project Libraries**:

   In NetBeans, right-click on your project in the `Projects` tab, then select `Properties`. 

   - Click on `Libraries`.
   - Click on `Add JAR/Folder...`.
   - Navigate to the downloaded MySQL Connector/J JAR file and add it to the project libraries.

3. **Test the Connection**:

   Open the project source code and locate the database connection settings. Ensure that you are using the correct driver class and database URL. For example:

   ```java
   String driver = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"; // for MySQL Connector/J 5.0.7
   // OR
   String driver = "com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"; // for MySQL Connector/J 8.0.17
   String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/digitaltech"; // Replace 'digitaltech' with your database name
   String username = "root"; // Replace with your MySQL username
   String password = ""; // Replace with your MySQL password

If you encounter issues with the database connection, ensure that your MySQL server (e.g., WAMP or XAMPP) is up and running.

Import the Database:

You can import the database by following these steps:

Open phpMyAdmin in your web server tool (WAMP or XAMPP).
Create a new database named digitaltech (or the name you specified in the connection settings).
Use the Import feature in phpMyAdmin to import the digitaltech.sql file included in this repository.
Now you should be able to run the project and interact with the database.
